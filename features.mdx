|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Full-Text Search | Matches keywords across all docs     | `authentication`  |
| Tag Filtering    | Narrow by labels like `api` or `guide` | `tag:api`        |
| Advanced Filters | Date range, author, or status        | `after:2024-01-01` |
